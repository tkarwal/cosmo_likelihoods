# DESI DR2 BAO
### Likelihood for MontePython


Likelihood based on Cobaya version of DESI DR2 BAO data from Antony Lewis. This combines all BAO data from DESI DR2 taking into account crosscorrelations. 

Tanvi Karwal adapting it to MP. 

## Instructions

1) Copy the `data/DESI_DR2` folder to the `montepython_public/data/` folder in MP. So you should now have a folder `montepython_public/data/DESI_DR2`

2) Copy the `likelihoods/bao_DESI_DR2` folder to `/montepython_public/montepython/likelihoods` such that you now have a folder `/montepython_public/montepython/likelihoods/bao_DESI_DR2` with files including `__init__.py`

3) Include the DES Y5 likelihood in your likelihoods block of the param file as
```

data.experiments=['bao_DESI_DR2']

```
