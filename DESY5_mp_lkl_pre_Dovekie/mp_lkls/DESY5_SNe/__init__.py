.. module:: DESY5_SNe
    :synopsis: DES Y5 Supernova likelihood 

.. moduleauthor:: Tanvi Karwal with help from Dillon Brout

Based loosely on the previous Pantheon_Plus lkl from Vivian Poulin and Dillon Brout
Major changes to read in DES Y5 SNe data and covariance matrix, and to allow for option
to use only DES SNe or all SNe in the sample.

.. code::

    C00 = mag_covmat_file

.. note::

    Since there are a lot of file manipulation involved, the "pandas" library
    has to be installed -- it is an 8-fold improvement in speed over numpy, and
    a 2-fold improvement over a fast Python implementation. The "numexpr"
    library is also needed for doing the fast array manipulations, done with
    blas daxpy function in the original c++ code. Both can be installed with
    pip (Python package manager) easily.
